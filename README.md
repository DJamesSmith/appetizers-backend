This project is inspired by Sean Allen’s **SwiftUI Fundamentals** course — specifically the *Appetizers* app.  
In his version, Sean built a simple backend API to serve appetizer data to the SwiftUI app.  
I decided to build my **own version** of that backend — not by copying, but by creating everything from scratch in my own way.

I wanted to understand how each piece fits together, from API design to database connections.  
By building the backend myself, I’m not limited by what any free or paid APIs provide — I decide what data exists, how it’s structured, and how it’s delivered.

### 💡 Why I’m Building My Own API
I wanted full control over the data, structure, and endpoints.  
By creating my own API, I can:
- Design data models that perfectly match my app’s needs  
- Experiment with custom endpoints and relationships  
- Learn how to handle image uploads, database operations, and API logic  
- Build a backend that’s completely flexible and under my control  

### ⚙️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Node.js + Express** – backend framework  
- **MongoDB** – for data storage  
- **Multer** – to handle image uploads  
- **Custom API endpoints** – to serve appetizer data to my SwiftUI frontend

> 🧠 This project is part learning, part building — my way of understanding the backend side of app development while having complete freedom over how data flows between my API and SwiftUI app.
