# 🍽️ Appetizers Backend

This project is inspired by Sean Allen’s **SwiftUI Fundamentals** course — specifically the *Appetizers* app.  
In his version, the data comes from a static JSON file, but I wanted to take it further by building **my own real API** from scratch.

Instead of relying on free or paid APIs that might limit what data I can access or how it’s structured, I decided to create a backend myself.  
This gives me the freedom to design the data exactly the way I need it for my app — without restrictions, limits, or dependency on external services.

### 💡 Why I’m Building My Own API
I wanted full control over the data, structure, and endpoints.  
By handling everything myself, I can:
- Create the exact data models I want  
- Design endpoints that fit perfectly with my SwiftUI frontend  
- Experiment and learn backend concepts hands-on  
- Build a complete, self-contained ecosystem for my app

### ⚙️ Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Node.js + Express** – backend framework  
- **MongoDB** – database management  
- **Multer** – for handling image uploads  
- **Custom API endpoints** – to serve appetizer data to my SwiftUI app

> 🧠 This project is all about learning, building, and gaining full control — combining my SwiftUI frontend with a backend I completely understand and own.
